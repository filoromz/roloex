# 1.0 Introduction
Welcome to ROLOEX-RPG! This is just an RPG-like game designed by a couple of bored and random University students! Our names are Rommel, Alex and Michael. :)

# 1.1 Storyline ( Work in progress )
You control a Hero and you must venture out into the unknown lands of Amaroo.
 Your main mission is to recover the Shield Of Honour (SOH) forged by a group of mysterious High Elves who call themselves the Shnits.

# 2.0 Gameplay
At the moment, the gameplay will be console-based, where you feed in user-input and a system prompt or response is given in the console.

# 3.0 Features
Similar to any rogue-like game, you will control a main Character who will be placed on a Map.
The Map will be filled with different types of Terrain which will give different types of effect on the Hero depending on the Terrain's type.
Each terrain will also spawn different classes of Enemies/Monsters.
here will also be a Village where the Hero can rest and regain all their HP/MP

# 4.0 Implementation
At the moment, the implementation of this RPG-like game is 100% purely done in JAVA :)
But we have thoughts of pushing this to a more proper game engine and possibly a GUI-like feature in the future! Stay tuned!
